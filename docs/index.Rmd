```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## barchart

```{r, eval=F}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20), script = "barchart.js")
```

## d3

```{r}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(script = "iq_scene.js", d3_version="4")
#r2d3(script = "r2d3_issue_31_append_g.js") # , d3_version="3")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
